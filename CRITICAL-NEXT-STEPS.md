# Critical Next Steps

This document outlines the critical refactoring steps needed to address the remaining issues in the MCP Tree-sitter Server project.

## Current Status

We've made significant progress in fixing linting issues and implementing key features. The following work has been completed:

1. âœ… Created a dedicated tree-sitter type handling module (`utils/tree_sitter_types.py`)
2. âœ… Updated `cache/parser_cache.py` to use the new typing utilities
3. âœ… Updated `language/registry.py` to use the new typing utilities
4. âœ… Created file I/O utilities (`utils/file_io.py`)
5. âœ… Fixed analysis.py file operations
6. âœ… Created tree-sitter API helper functions (`utils/tree_sitter_helpers.py`)
7. âœ… Added TreeCursor protocol to `utils/tree_sitter_types.py`
8. âœ… Created cursor helper functions in `utils/tree_sitter_helpers.py`
9. âœ… Extended `cache/parser_cache.py` to track tree modification state
10. âœ… Implemented tree editing methods in `utils/tree_sitter_helpers.py`
11. âœ… Added support for changed_ranges detection
12. âœ… Created a context utility module (`utils/context/mcp_context.py`)
13. âœ… Added progress reporting infrastructure to long-running operations
14. âœ… Implemented context-aware methods for tools
15. âœ… Created `capabilities/server_capabilities.py` for capability declaration
16. âœ… Added resource subscription support
17. âœ… Added completion suggestions support
18. âœ… Fixed type-checking issues in tree-sitter protocol interfaces
19. âœ… Fixed node type handling in cursor traversal for null safety
20. âœ… Fixed type annotations for query captures in analysis tools

## Immediate Next Steps

The following tasks need to be addressed next:

1. ðŸ”„ **Integrate tree-sitter-language-pack for Language Support**
   - Replace individual language parser dependencies with tree-sitter-language-pack
   - Update language registry to use language pack API
   - Fix language detection and loading mechanisms
   - Update related tools to use the new API consistently
   - See [Appendix: Language Pack Integration](#appendix-language-pack-integration) for details

2. ðŸ”„ **Implement Cursor-based AST Traversal in Models**
   - Update `models/ast.py` to use cursor-based tree traversal for efficiency
   - Replace recursive traversal with more efficient cursor-based navigation
   - Add helper functions to simplify common traversal patterns
   - Handle null nodes safely throughout traversal code

3. ðŸ”„ **Implement Additional Testing**
   - Implement additional test cases for the tree-sitter utilities
   - Add tests for context utilities and progress reporting
   - Test incremental parsing with various code changes
   - Create test cases for tree cursor traversal
   - Add tests for tree-sitter type safety mechanisms

4. ðŸ”„ **Enhance Claude Desktop Integration**
   - Complete environment variable handling
   - Enhance integration with Claude UX
   - Add user-friendly error messages for common issues
   - Improve documentation for Claude Desktop integration

5. ðŸ”„ **Documentation Updates**
   - Update docstrings to reflect type safety improvements
   - Create detailed documentation for tree-sitter typing strategy
   - Document common patterns for tree traversal using cursors
   - Add examples of best practices for tree-sitter interaction

Once these items are completed, CRITICAL-NEXT-STEPS.md can be deprecated.

## Implementation Details

### Tree-sitter Type Safety

The tree-sitter type handling has been significantly improved:
- Added appropriate interfaces via Protocol classes
- Implemented safe type casting with runtime verification
- Added null-safety checks throughout cursor traversal code
- Used targeted type suppressions for API compatibility issues
- Added clear documentation for type handling patterns

### TreeCursor Enhancements

The TreeCursor API implementation now provides:
- Type-safe cursor traversal with proper Optional type handling
- Null-safe navigation through node children and siblings
- Efficient collector patterns for gathering nodes
- Better handling of potential runtime type variations
- Safe parent-child relationship traversal

### Type-Safe Query Handling

Query processing now includes:
- Explicit type casting for query captures
- Safe unpacking of node-capture pairs
- Better error handling for malformed queries
- Type-safe processing of query results

Remaining implementation details from the previous version are still applicable.

## Conclusion

Our recent improvements have significantly enhanced type safety and robustness when interacting with the tree-sitter library. The remaining tasks focus on extending these patterns to other parts of the codebase and ensuring comprehensive testing.

With the type-checking issues largely resolved, we can now focus on improving efficiency through cursor-based traversal in all parts of the codebase and enhancing the testing coverage to ensure long-term stability.

Once these immediate next steps are completed, we can move on to the additional feature improvements outlined in the ROADMAP.md document.

## Appendix: Language Pack Integration

### Problem Statement

The current implementation attempts to import individual tree-sitter language modules (e.g., `tree_sitter_python`), which causes failures when these modules are not installed. The auto-installation mechanism is disabled by default, and even when enabled, it requires server restarts after installing each language module.

### Solution: tree-sitter-language-pack

The [tree-sitter-language-pack](https://github.com/Goldziher/tree-sitter-language-pack) package provides a comprehensive collection of 100+ tree-sitter languages in a single package with pre-built wheels. It offers a clean API to access language parsers without requiring individual installations.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update Dependencies**
   - Add `tree-sitter-language-pack` to dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
   - Remove individual language parser dependencies from `[project.optional-dependencies]`

2. **Modify Language Registry**
   - Update `src/mcp_server_tree_sitter/language/registry.py` to use the language pack API:
     - Replace direct imports with `from tree_sitter_language_pack import get_language, get_parser`
     - Update `get_language()` method to use `get_language()` from the language pack
     - Update `get_parser()` method to use `get_parser()` from the language pack

3. **Update Configuration**
   - Modify `config.py` to remove `auto_install` option (no longer needed)
   - Add configuration for language pack preferences if necessary

4. **Update Related Code**
   - Fix any code that references individual language modules
   - Update error handling for language loading to reflect new approach
   - Ensure all language loading uses the language pack consistently

5. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Test language detection and loading with various file types
   - Update documentation to reference language pack instead of individual modules
   - Add information about available languages to user documentation

This approach will simplify the codebase, improve reliability, and provide access to a much wider range of languages without requiring individual installations or server restarts.

### Example Implementation
