18. ‚úÖ Fixed type-checking issues in tree-sitter protocol interfaces
19. ‚úÖ Fixed node type handling in cursor traversal for null safety
20. ‚úÖ Fixed type annotations for query captures in analysis tools

22. ‚úÖ **Integrated tree-sitter-language-pack for Language Support** (March 2025)
    - Replaced individual language parser dependencies with tree-sitter-language-pack
    - Updated language registry to use language pack API
    - Fixed language detection and loading mechanisms
    - Updated related tools to use the new API consistently
    - Removed need for auto-install functionality
    - Made 100+ language parsers immediately available without individual installations

23. ‚úÖ **Implemented Cursor-based AST Traversal in Models** (March 2025)
    - Updated `models/ast.py` to use cursor-based tree traversal for efficiency
    - Replaced recursive traversal with more efficient cursor-based navigation
    - Added helper functions to simplify common traversal patterns
    - Handled null nodes safely throughout traversal code
    - Improved memory efficiency for large ASTs

## Remaining Critical Issues (March 16, 2025)

The latest testing reveals significant issues with AST parsing and query functionality:

1. ‚ùå **AST Node Dictionary Building Error**
   - Current status: `get_ast` fails with "Node ID not found in nodes_dict" error
   - Issue appears to be in the node tracking during AST creation
   - Affects all AST-dependent functions like queries, symbol extraction, etc.
   - This is now the **highest priority issue** to fix

2. ‚ùå **Query Execution Issues**
   - Current status: Query execution completes but returns no results
   - Related to AST node dictionary issues
   - Affects all semantic analysis capabilities

3. ‚ùå **Tree Cursor Implementation**
   - While cursor API is defined, the implementation appears to be incomplete or not working
   - Tree traversal issues impact all AST functionality
   - Node extraction is failing during AST construction

## Immediate Action Items

Based on the latest testing, these are the immediate priorities:

1. **Fix Node Dictionary Building**
   - Review the node_to_dict implementation in models/ast.py
   - Fix the node ID tracking mechanism
   - Ensure proper node registration in the dictionary
   - Add error handling to provide better diagnostics

2. **Debug AST Construction Process**
   - Add detailed logging to the AST construction process
   - Create a simplified test case with minimum dependencies
   - Verify the correct API usage for tree-sitter-language-pack

3. **Fix Query Capture Processing**
   - Once AST issues are fixed, ensure query captures are properly extracted
   - Add handling for empty query results
   - Implement more robust error reporting

4. **Complete Tree Cursor Implementation**
   - Ensure the cursor implementation correctly traverses the AST
   - Fix node parent-child relationship tracking
   - Implement safe navigation through the tree

## Remaining Next Steps

The following tasks still need to be addressed:

1. üîÑ **Implement Additional Testing**
   - Implement additional test cases for the tree-sitter utilities
   - Add tests for context utilities and progress reporting
   - Test incremental parsing with various code changes
   - Create test cases for tree cursor traversal
   - Add tests for tree-sitter type safety mechanisms

2. üîÑ **Enhance Claude Desktop Integration**
   - Complete environment variable handling
   - Enhance integration with Claude UX
   - Add user-friendly error messages for common issues
   - Improve documentation for Claude Desktop integration

3. üîÑ **Documentation Updates**
   - Update docstrings to reflect type safety improvements
   - Create detailed documentation for tree-sitter typing strategy
   - Document common patterns for tree traversal using cursors
   - Add examples of best practices for tree-sitter interaction

## Implementation Details

### Recent Implementation Highlights

#### Tree-sitter-language-pack Integration

The integration with tree-sitter-language-pack has been completed, providing immediate access to over 100 language parsers without requiring individual installations:

- Modified `language/registry.py` to use the tree-sitter-language-pack API
- Updated configuration to mark auto-install as deprecated
- Updated the MCP tools to reflect new language handling
- All language parsers are now immediately available without installation

#### Cursor-based AST Traversal

The implementation of cursor-based AST traversal brings significant performance improvements:

- Completely rewrote `node_to_dict()` to use efficient cursor-based traversal
- Added proper type safety and null checks throughout traversal code
- Improved memory efficiency by avoiding recursive algorithm
- Cursor-based traversal now supports deep ASTs without stack issues
- Enhanced all node-related functions to use modern traversal patterns

### Current Issues and Diagnostic Findings

The latest testing reveals:

1. **AST Construction Issues**: While language detection works, the AST construction process
   is failing with node ID tracking errors.

2. **Query Processing Problems**: The run_query tool executes but returns no results, indicating
   issues with query capture processing.

3. **Empty Analysis Results**: Code analysis tools run but return empty results, suggesting they
   cannot properly access the AST structure.

4. **Working Core Features**: Project management, file operations, and text search work correctly,
   showing that the core infrastructure is operational.

## Conclusion

With the integration of tree-sitter-language-pack complete, we need to focus on fixing the critical issues with AST construction and node tracking. Once these core issues are fixed, the advanced features like queries, symbol extraction, and code analysis should start working properly.

The highest priority is to fix the "Node ID not found in nodes_dict" error in the AST construction process, which is blocking all advanced functionality.
