"""Test cases for known tree-sitter failure modes identified in FEATURES.md.

This module contains mock-based tests that verify the handling of all failure modes
documented in FEATURES.md, ensuring that:
1. The code properly handles error conditions
2. Appropriate error messages or empty responses are returned
3. Edge cases are managed correctly

These tests help ensure robust behavior even in known failure scenarios.
