## Implementation Status

### Language Pack Integration

The integration of tree-sitter-language-pack is complete with comprehensive language support. All 31 languages are available and functional.

| Feature Area | Status | Test Results |
|--------------|--------|--------------|
| Language Tools | ‚úÖ Working | All tests pass. Language tools properly report and list available languages |
| AST Analysis | ‚úÖ Working | All tests pass. `get_ast` and `get_node_at_position` work correctly with proper node IDs and AST traversal operations |
| Search Queries | ‚úÖ Working | All tests pass. Text search works, query building works, and tree-sitter query execution returns expected results |
| Code Analysis | ‚úÖ Working | All tests pass. Structure and complexity analysis works, symbol extraction and dependency analysis provide useful results |

**Current Integration Capabilities:**
- AST functionality works well for retrieving and traversing trees and nodes
- Query execution and result handling work correctly
- Symbol extraction and dependency analysis provide useful results
- Project management, file operations, and search features work correctly

### Implementation Gaps

Based on the latest tests as of March 18, 2025, these are the current implementation gaps:

#### Tree Editing and Incremental Parsing
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working
- Core AST functionality works
- Tree manipulation functionality requires additional implementation

#### Tree Cursor API
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Working
- AST node traversal works correctly
- Cursor-based tree walking is efficient and reliable
- Can be extended for more advanced semantic analysis

#### Similar Code Detection
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working
- Command executes successfully but testing did not yield results
- May require more specific snippets or fine-tuning of similarity thresholds

#### UTF-16 Support
- **Status:** ‚ùå Not Implemented
- Encoding detection and support is not yet available
- Will require parser improvements after core AST functionality is fixed

#### Read Callable Support
- **Status:** ‚ùå Not Implemented
- Custom read strategies are not yet available
- Streaming parsing for large files remains unavailable

### MCP SDK Implementation

## Implementation Notes

This project uses a structured dependency injection (DI) pattern, but still has global singletons at its core:

1. A central `DependencyContainer` singleton that holds all shared services
2. A `global_context` object that provides a convenient interface to the container
3. API functions that access the container internally

This architecture provides three main ways to access functionality:

```python
# Option 1: API Functions (preferred for most use cases)
from mcp_server_tree_sitter.api import get_config, get_language_registry

config = get_config()
languages = get_language_registry().list_available_languages()

# Option 2: Direct Container Access
from mcp_server_tree_sitter.di import get_container

container = get_container()
project_registry = container.project_registry
tree_cache = container.tree_cache

# Option 3: Global Context
from mcp_server_tree_sitter.context import global_context

config = global_context.get_config()
result = global_context.register_project("/path/to/project")
```

The dependency injection approach helps make the code more testable and maintainable, even though it still uses singletons internally.

## Testing Guidelines

When testing the MCP Tree-sitter server, use this structured approach:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Register a project with `register_project_tool`
   - Verify registration with `list_projects_tool`

2. **Basic File Operations**
   - Test `list_files` to ensure project access
   - Test `get_file` to verify content retrieval
   - Test `get_file_metadata` to check file information

3. **Language Parser Verification**
   - Test `check_language_available` to verify specific language support
   - Use `list_languages` to see all available languages

4. **Feature Testing**
   - Test AST operations with `get_ast` to ensure proper node IDs and structure
   - Test query execution with `run_query` to verify proper result capture
   - Test symbol extraction with `get_symbols` to verify proper function, class, and import detection
   - Test dependency analysis with `get_dependencies` to verify proper import detection
   - Test complexity analysis with `analyze_complexity` to verify metrics are being calculated correctly
   - Test usage finding with `find_usage` to verify proper symbol reference detection

5. **Test Outcomes**
   - All 185 tests now pass successfully
   - No diagnostic errors reported
   - Core functionality works reliably across all test cases

7. **‚ö†Ô∏è Similar Code Detection**
   - Command completes execution but testing did not yield results
   - May need further investigation with more appropriate test cases

8. **Future Work: Complete MCP Context Progress Reporting**
   - Add progress reporting for long-running operations to improve user experience
