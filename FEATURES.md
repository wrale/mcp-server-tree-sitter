# Get descriptions of node types
get_node_types(language="python")
```

### Code Analysis Commands

These commands analyze code structure and complexity.

|---------|--------|--------------|-------|
| `get_symbols` | ‚úÖ | Project registration | Successfully extracts symbols (functions, classes, imports) from files |
| `analyze_project` | ‚úÖ | Project registration | Project structure analysis works with support for detailed code analysis |
| `get_dependencies` | ‚úÖ | Project registration | Successfully identifies dependencies from import statements |
| `analyze_complexity` | ‚úÖ | Project registration | Provides accurate code complexity metrics |
| `find_similar_code` | ‚úÖ | None | Finds similar code patterns across project files |
| `find_usage` | ‚úÖ | None | Successfully finds usage of symbols across project files |

**Previous Issues (Now Fixed):**
- ‚úÖ Commands now return proper results rather than empty data
- ‚úÖ AST-dependent functionality now works reliably with all supported languages

clear_cache(project="my-project")

# Configure cache settings
configure(cache_enabled=True, max_file_size_mb=10, log_level="DEBUG")
```

## Implementation Status

### Language Pack Integration

The integration of tree-sitter-language-pack is complete with comprehensive language support.

| Feature Area | Previous Status | Current Status | Test Results |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Language Tools | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | ‚úÖ Working | Language tools properly report and list available languages |
| AST Analysis | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | ‚úÖ Working | `get_ast` and `get_node_at_position` work, and AST traversal operations work correctly |
| Search Queries | ‚úÖ Working | ‚úÖ Working | Text search works, query building works, and tree-sitter query execution returns expected results |
| Code Analysis | ‚úÖ Working | ‚úÖ Working | Structure and complexity analysis works, symbol extraction and dependency analysis provide useful results |

**Current Integration Capabilities:**
- AST functionality works well for retrieving and traversing trees and nodes
- Query execution and result handling work correctly
- Symbol extraction and dependency analysis provide useful results
- Project management, file operations, and search features work correctly

### Implementation Gaps

Based on the latest tests, these are the current implementation gaps:

#### Tree Editing and Incremental Parsing
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working
- Core AST functionality works
- Tree manipulation functionality requires additional implementation

#### Tree Cursor API

## Testing Guidelines

When testing the MCP Tree-sitter server, use this structured approach:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Register a project with `register_project_tool`
   - Verify registration with `list_projects_tool`

2. **Basic File Operations**
   - Test `list_files` to ensure project access
   - Test `get_file` to verify content retrieval
   - Test `get_file_metadata` to check file information

3. **Language Parser Verification**
   - Test `check_language_available` to verify specific language support
   - Use `list_languages` to see all available languages

4. **Feature Testing**
   - All core features now work as expected: project management, file operations, search, AST operations, query execution
   - All tests pass successfully

5. **Previously Fixed Error Cases**
   - ‚úÖ AST operations previously returned errors about missing node IDs
   - ‚úÖ Symbol extraction and dependency analysis now return expected results
   - ‚úÖ Query execution now returns proper results

---

## Implementation Progress

Based on the test results, these are the recently completed and remaining tasks:

1. **‚úÖ FIXED: Tree-Sitter Query Result Handling**
   - Query result handling has been fixed
   - Queries now execute and return proper results with correct capture processing

2. **‚úÖ FIXED: Tree Cursor Functionality**
   - Tree cursor-based traversal is working correctly
   - Efficient navigation and analysis of ASTs is now possible

3. **‚úÖ FIXED: Query Execution Output**
   - Query execution now returns appropriate results with proper capture handling

4. **Remaining: Complete MCP Context Progress Reporting**
   - Add progress reporting for long-running operations to improve user experience
